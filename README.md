# Round 2! FIGHT

Let's go! Time to get hairy with some css - we're digging into Grid and Flexbox now! Whoot!

You've got a simple HTML file and an empty CSS file - let's make them better! Follow the
instructions below - don't forget to consult the curriculum if you're unsure on something!

Instructions:

1) Adjust the width of the .box class to 400px and change the background color to light blue.

2) Add a 10px padding to the top and bottom of the .box class.

3) Create a new class named .box-with-margin and add a margin of 30px.

4) Change the position of the .static-element class to relative.

5) Move the .relative-element 50px to the right using the left property.

6) Change the position property of the .absolute-element class to relative.

7) Set the top property of the .absolute-element class to 150px.

8) Adjust the position of the .fixed-element class so that it is fixed to the bottom right corner of the viewport.

9) Add a 1px solid border with a light gray color to the .column class.

10) Change the float property of the .column class to right.

11) Change the display property of the .container class to inline-flex.

12) Adjust the width of the .item class to 200px.

13) Add a 20px margin to the right of each .item class.
